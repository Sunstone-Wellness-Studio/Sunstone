                I have confidence in your ability to foster change, and I'm
                committed to assisting you on that journey. Many of us grapple
                with negative beliefs that hinder self-recognition, causing us
                to occasionally lose our way. However, overcoming these
                challenges is possible, and I'm here to support you.

                I specialize in assisting adults navigating life transitions and
                women coping with high-functioning anxiety, trauma, and
                depression. Through the use of DBT, somatic therapy, and
                mindfulness techniques, we can interrupt negative thought
                patterns and reactivity. Together, we'll collaborate to
                alleviate the burdens you carry, boost your self-esteem, reshape
                your mindset, and foster more meaningful connections.

                    Assisting clients in identifying negative or anxious
                    thoughts is a key aspect of our approach. Through assigned
                    homework, individuals are guided to observe and become aware
                    of their self-talk. Additionally, we provide instruction on
                    the use of visualization as a powerful tool to ground them
                    in the present moment, breaking free from the persistent
                    cycle of negative thoughts. Our focus extends to addressing
                    negative core beliefs, working towards restoring
                    self-confidence.

                    Mindfulness is simply the practice of being present in
                    daily life, It encompasses being present with those around
                    you and with what you are doing. The focus is on increasing
                    our awareness of the thoughts, feelings, and actions that
                    hinder our progress.. As we enhance this awareness, we
                    empower ourselves to engage with these aspects, adjust our
                    language, and consciously choose our responses.
